ArchoPlanet
===========
If you change the code, copy paste it into Archoplanet.blend internal notepad. I could have link it, but it wouldn't work on both Linux and Windows
There are still some problems with relative path, so better close Blender at all and then open ArchoPlanet.blend
On Linux, if you need debug console opened while working with ArchoPlanet, in command line first cd to ArchoPlanet directory, then open Blender and Archoplanet as normal
